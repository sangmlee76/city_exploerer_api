## Getting Started
Build a stand-alone back end which will interact with a static front end. It will request data from a total of six third-party APIs, modify the data as needed, and send the data to the client to be displayed in the browser. In subsequent updates (by 22 Jan 21 ), it will be persisting data in a SQL database.
